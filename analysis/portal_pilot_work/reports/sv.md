## Gleanings

  - All slopes for abundance are significant to .05 and positive; only 2
    are significant for energy.
  - For abundance, all communities have slopes that are positive (but
    not huge - around .05) and significant.
  - For energy, control has a near-0 slope and not significant, terrible
    r2. Spectabs has positive slope but not significant. Exclosure and
    removal have positive slopes, significant.
