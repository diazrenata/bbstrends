The intuition for this project comes strongly from the work using the BioTIME database.

There are three really relevant papers from that database. 

One objective is to flesh out what we learn from that work (which looks at *population trends*, *species richness*, and *total abundance in individuals (or biomass, but not both)*). This includes *additional currencies*, energy and biomass, and *population vs assemblage*.

A second objective relates to trade-offs between the currencies. Relevant papers there are White et al 2007 (Tradeoffs through time) and 2009 (Changes in a tropical forest)
