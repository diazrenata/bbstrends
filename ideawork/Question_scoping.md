The intuition for this project comes strongly from the work using the BioTIME database.

There are three really relevant papers from that database. 

One objective is to flesh out what we learn from that work (which looks at *population trends*, *species richness*, and *total abundance in individuals (or biomass, but not both)*). This includes *additional currencies*, energy and biomass, and *population vs assemblage*.

A second objective relates to trade-offs between the currencies. Relevant papers there are White et al 2007 (Tradeoffs through time) and 2009 (Changes in a tropical forest)

## Assemblage-level trends

For any given currency, I see 2 questions:
- Random walk vs regulated
- Trending vs no slope
- Maybe these fit into a 2x2 table? 
    - Nonzero slope + not stationary
    - Nonzero slope + regulated
    - Zero slope + not regulated
    - Zero slope + regulated


I'm inclined to focus first on the trend *slope*: In particular, do we see consistent *declines* in abundance, energy, or both? 

Headlines from BioTIME studies might lead us to expect no slope for abundance, but those studies do not actually amount to an expectation of no slope. *Species richness* and *populations* have no consistent slopes, but the *relative abundances of populations* as well as *colonizations and extinctions* introduce wiggle room between tallying the slopes of individual populations and the overall trend. I find it curious that they have not published on the overall slope. More generalized concerns about defaunation, declines in population sizes, would point towards an expectation for general declines.

## Population vs assemblage

- Tallying population slopes fails to account for relative abudnances. If rare species are stable but abundant species decline, the overwhelming signal is decline.
- The best tally of *slopes* is of population slopes.
