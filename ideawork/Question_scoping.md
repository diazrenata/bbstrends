The intuition for this project comes strongly from the work using the BioTIME database.

There are three really relevant papers from that database. 

One objective is to flesh out what we learn from that work (which looks at *population trends*, *species richness*, and *total abundance in individuals (or biomass, but not both)*). This includes *additional currencies*, energy and biomass, and *population vs assemblage*.

A second objective relates to trade-offs between the currencies. Relevant papers there are White et al 2007 (Tradeoffs through time) and 2009 (Changes in a tropical forest)

__Additional currencies__

__Population vs assemblage__

__Trade-offs between currencies__


## Assemblage-level trends

For any given currency, I see 2 questions:
- Random walk vs regulated
- Trending vs no slope
- Maybe these fit into a 2x2 table? 
    - Nonzero slope + not stationary
    - Nonzero slope + regulated
    - Zero slope + not regulated
    - Zero slope + regulated

## Population vs assemblage

- Tallying population slopes fails to account for relative abudnances. If rare species are stable but abundant species decline, the overwhelming signal is decline.
- The best tally of *slopes* is of population slopes.

## Currency tradeoffs
